{"name":"The Rubin Way","tagline":"\"Keep it simple, stupid\"","body":"## About me\r\n\r\nHey, I'm Alan Rubin, I'm a human (first thing!), born in Rio, Brazil and living in beautiful Israel, married with 4 beautiful children and working as a developer consultant and team leader in challenging projects happening in different clients across Israel and Europe.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, software/web development is an **ART** and should be crafted with great talent, care and love. Being a team leader, I believe even more important then that is the care for **PEOPLE** in the process. I have great love for what I do and for people around me and I enjoy every step in the journey. \r\n\r\nI’m currently focused on end to end research, design and development of web applications from a full-stack (!?) perspective. \r\n\r\nOn the UI side, my love currently goes to HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with a bunch of CoffeeScript as well), AngularJS, React and Flux and a bunch of other libraries and frameworks. I really really enjoy a good piece of design and (I think!) I have a good eye for beautiful visual implementations, crafted using high standards of user interaction and usability. \r\n\r\nLately I'm a bit less active on the server side scene but I have lots of experience in crafting backends using Java and Ruby (still sharing a very special relation with Ruby to tell the truth...).\r\n\r\nI found essential to be part of an open-minded, agile and dynamic work environment, formed by awesome people in all aspects, both technically and personally. The work environment must value good quality and simple solutions and delivers customer oriented products. \r\n\r\nOn the Academic scene, I hold a B.Sc. at Computers and Electronics Engineering (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and an almost 85% M.Sc.at Computer Science (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel).\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial speaking, I’m very interested at startups and ideas that may turn into startups. I have many ideas that I would be happy to share (and implement!).\r\n\r\nIf you are interesting in contacting me, please feel free to send me an email – alan at frubin dot com.\r\n\r\n## My Blog\r\nI used to have a blog here, it became really obsolete at the moment. Working to have something on Medium.com as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n## My Projects\r\nPlaceholder for my projects. Keep connected.\r\n\r\n## My Presentations\r\n* I will be presenting Flux and Reflux.js in the upcoming [ReactIL meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-IL/events/223120671/). Slides/videos will be published here.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
