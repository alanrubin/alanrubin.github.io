<p>Hey, I'm Alan Rubin, I'm a human (first thing!), born in Rio, Brazil and living in beautiful Israel, married with 4 beautiful children and working as a developer consultant and team leader in challenging projects happening in different clients across Israel and Europe.</p>

<p>In my opinion, software/web development is an <strong>ART</strong> and should be crafted with great talent, care and love. Being a team leader, I believe even more important then that is the care for <strong>PEOPLE</strong> in the process. I have great love for what I do and for people around me and I enjoy every step in the journey. </p>

<p>I’m currently focused on end to end research, design and development of web applications from a full-stack (!?) perspective. </p>

<p>On the UI side, my love currently goes to HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with a bunch of CoffeeScript as well), AngularJS, React and Flux and a bunch of other libraries and frameworks. I really really enjoy a good piece of design and (I think!) I have a good eye for beautiful visual implementations, crafted using high standards of user interaction and usability. </p>

<p>Lately I'm a bit less active on the server side scene but I have lots of experience in crafting backends using Java and Ruby (still sharing a very special relation with Ruby to tell the truth...).</p>

<p>I found essential to be part of an open-minded, agile and dynamic work environment, formed by awesome people, specially in technical and personal aspects. The work environment must value good people, quality and simple solutions and delivers customer oriented products. </p>

<p>On the Academic scene, I hold a B.Sc. at Computers and Electronics Engineering (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and a 85% incomplete :( M.Sc. at Computer Science (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel).</p>

<p>Entrepreneurial speaking, I’m very interested at startups and ideas that may turn into startups. I have many ideas that I would be happy to share (and implement!).</p>
